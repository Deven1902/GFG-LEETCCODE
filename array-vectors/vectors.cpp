/*
this is how a simple vector decalration looks like in Cpp. 

Below we have listed a few advantages of using Vectors:- 
1) Dynamci size.
2) rich library functions.
3) easy to know the size.
4) no need to pass size as a parameter.\
5) can be returned from a function.
6) By default initialized with defualt values.
7) we can copy one vector to other -> v1 = v2.
